## hedge-rs

A cluster membership Rust library. It is built on [spindle-rs](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/spindle-rs), a distributed locking library built on [Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/) and [TrueTime](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/true-time-external-consistency). It is a port (subset only) of [hedge](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/hedge). Ported features include:

* Tracking of member nodes - good for clusters with sizes that can change dynamically overtime, such as [GCP MIGs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups#managed_instance_groups), and [Kubernetes Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/);
* Leader election - the cluster elects and maintains a single leader node at all times;
* List of members - get a list of all member nodes at any time;
* Send - any member node can send messages to the leader at any time;
* Broadcast - any member node can broadcast messages to all nodes at any time.
